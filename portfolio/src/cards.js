		description: `Pathcore approached me with a job to redesign their old wordpress site which over the years started to look inconsistent and without a clear design guideline. I decided to overhaul the site entirely and start from scratch to build an Express app that could be customizable through Contentful's content platform. Pathcore has numerous different services that we wanted to showcase in a brochure style website and worked closely with an illustrator to create the relevant assets. While design isn't my strongest suit, my goal was to create a clear design guideline for their product for consistent branding. The site itself is made up with various reusable components and if their in house staff need to add more services to show, it would be easy for them to create new pages and maintain the overall style of the site.`,
